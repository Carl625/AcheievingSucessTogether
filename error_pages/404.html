		<p>There's no cool designs to see here.</p>

		<p>Just the classic black text on a white background.</p>

		<p>Here's a refresh button if you'd like something to click on. </p>
		<button onclick="window.refreshPage()">Refresh</button>

		<p>And this button takes you back to the last page you visited in case you're feeling particularly productive. </p>
		<button onclick="window.history.back()">Back</button>
